# Rage Room
<p align="justify">
Virtual Reality (VR) is a powerful tool for triggering deep emotional responses. By immersing users in vivid environments, VR facilitates intense personal experiences through narrative storytelling and interactive engagement. These capabilities make VR an effective medium for psychotherapy, phobia treatment, and various training scenarios.
The VR Rage Room, specifically harnesses VR's potential to provide a controlled environment where users can safely express and manage emotions such as anger and frustration. In this space, participants can interact with objects and scenarios that allow them to vent these feelings in a manner that feels real yet is completely safe and private.

This project was completed in a group of two. We explored various aspects through user testing, such as whether using a tunneling effect helped reduce nausea, the experience with and without haptic feedback, and the interaction with objects using one arm, which is the default method. Additionally, we introduced the option to grab weapons with both hands. The efforts to improve the experience were well received during the user tests. The lab, full of fellow classmates stressed about major submissions, appreciated the world we created where they could wreak havoc.
